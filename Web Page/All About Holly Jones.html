<!--Afew Paragraphs About Me-->
<p><b>I was born in November and I'm a Sagittarius.  I grew up in Newark, Delaware.  I love the winter and fall seasons. <b></p>
<p>I went to middle school at the Independence School, and I would like to live in either North Carolina or Boston when I am older.
As for career choice I would like to be in the medical field, but also be involved with sports.</p>
<p>Speaking of sports, I play field hockey and lacrosse for Padua and I wear number 15, and I play lacrosse outside of school for a travel team.  I also am a nationally competitive synchronized ice skater, and have competed at several national championships across the country.  
Because I get to travel so frequently for my sports, I have developed a love for traveling over the years.</p>
<p>My favorite colors are navy and gold, and my favorite animal is a Moose. Fun fact: I wear my hair in a bun every single day because I have crazy curly hair.  I love to watch all kinds of sports, especially lacrosse, ice hockey, and football.  My favorite place to travel is North Carolina.  I love playing with my dogs Flo and Lolo, and I love getting to spend time with my friends from various sports teams and from school.  I love pearls and bracelets, and my favorite thing to wear is my pearl necklace with an H on it that my best friend and I got at the beach together.</p>
